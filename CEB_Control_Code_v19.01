/* Open Source Ecology CEB Press v19.01 with Arduino Uno or Mega as controller of choice.
 Use Mega to keep consistency with OSE D3D 3D Printer to minimize GVCS part count.
 Switches FET's HIGH/LOW to control two hydraulic solenoids,
 measures piston motion time relative to pressure sensor trigger,
 and repeats cycle while auto calibrating timing from previous cycles and startup positions.
 
 Extension time is measured. No timing compensation is necessary for compression chamber closure.
 
 Faults should be self-resolving based on pressing sequence. See sequence:

 Uses HiLetgo Relay Shield 5V 4 Channel for Arduino.
 
 Relay shield - https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Relay-Shield-Channel-Arduino/dp/B07F7Y55Z7/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1547696929&sr=8-2&keywords=hiletgo+relay+shield
 
 Relay 1 is controlled by digital pin 7
 Relay 2 is controlled by digital pin 6
 Relay 3 is controlled by digital pin 5
 Relay 4 is controlled by digital pin 4

 A high written to a pin turns the relay ON
 A low written to a pin turns the relay OFF
